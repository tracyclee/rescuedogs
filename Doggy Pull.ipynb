       "  u'animalDescription': u'<div class=\"rgDescription\">Ross IS going to live at the assisted living home called The Hickman. He has one the heart\\'s of everyone there.<br>He has been very busy during the day giving hugs and kisses to everyone who wants his hugs and kisses. He is a truly sweet, gentle and loving soul --- just like ALL of the L&F Rescue Dogs, we only pull the best of the best from shelters.<br><br>Ross came to us from the Kent County SPCA.  He is about 4 or so years old. He was captured by animal control and was terribly frightened but still proved to be very gentle. That is his nature to be a sweet and gentle<br>boy. We will never understand this part but his family never came looking for this extremely sweet and gentle dog. <br><br>At the shelter he did tested positive for Heartworm but because The Kent County SPCA are so special and really care about the dogs who end up there, they treated his heartworm. We just had him re-tested and it barely showed up on the test so that proves his treatment worked perfectly.

       "  u'animalDescriptionPlain': u'Ross IS going to live at the assisted living home called The Hickman. He has one the heart\\'s of everyone there.He has been very busy during the day giving hugs and kisses to everyone who wants his hugs and kisses. He is a truly sweet, gentle and loving soul --- just like ALL of the L&F Rescue Dogs, we only pull the best of the best from shelters.Ross came to us from the Kent County SPCA.  He is about 4 or so years old. He was captured by animal control and was terribly frightened but still proved to be very gentle. That is his nature to be a sweet and gentleboy. We will never understand this part but his family never came looking for this extremely sweet and gentle dog. At the shelter he did tested positive for Heartworm but because The Kent County SPCA are so special and really care about the dogs who end up there, they treated his heartworm. We just had him re-tested and it barely showed up on the test so that proves his treatment worked perfectly. He will not have any problems with that again as long as we keep him on Heartworm medication. Gee, if his original family had done this, he would never have gotten it to begin with. So, if you think you would love to adopt a sweet, teddy bear of Golden, please apply online.PLEASE NOTE:  If you are applying for an adult dog, we do expect that if no one is home all day, arrangements will be made to provide the dog with at least (1) \"potty break\" daily, whether it is through a family member, neighbor or petsitting service.

We put a plea on our website for this sweet senior dog from WV hoping that someone would come along who would be willing to allow this wonderful Wetzel Hound to spend his remaining time with a family who would love and cherish him. Well, that family has adopted our Jack - formerly Universal. He is still young at heart and just LOVES LOVES LOVES people and has a kind and gentle spirit. So --- like we like to say here at L&F \"It was a GOOD DAY in rescue!\"<br><br>Jack is getting a new Mommy, Daddy and a 5 year old little boy who promptly started composing a song for his new dog. It was just wonderful to see. We are so happy for everyone involved. <br><br>We really have our wonderful Rosy from the Wetzel County Impoundment in WV to thank for this happy ending. Only she would do her best to get an old boy out of her shelter --- alive! Hats off to you Rosy for all the wonderful dogs you save and get to us here in DE. There are a lot of happy people who have adopted your dogs and pups. Thank YOU and we certainly appreciate your dedication to the animals who come into your care.<br><br>UPDATE from Jack\\'s foster Mom:<br>Jack, what a sweet guy he is!  He follows me everywhere; A more gentle, loyal companion would be hard to find.  I just wonder if he somehow got lost and couldn\\'t find his way back to his family.  I can\\'t imagine why anyone would willingly let this dog try to fend for himself.  He get\\'s around OK, loves to eat and just fits in here with no problems at all.  I\\'m just nuts about him. <br><br>URGENT!!! If someone, anyone, can make room for this poor old boy, please contact us. We would love to find him a home where he can spend his golden years loved and cherished. <br><br>Universal was found wandering down the highway in Universal, West Virginia. He was found staggering on a horribly hot summer day a couple of weeks ago.  The kind folks that brought him into the Wetzel County Impoundment Shelter thought he was injured. It turns out he is almost completely blind, and almost deaf. Universal was just a throw away dog that someone did not want anymore. He was simply dumped along the highway. <br><br>We have found Universal to be so-o-o-o young in spirit and actually does great physically also!!! There is a lot of life and love in this old guy. He had to be shaved and by the looks of his feet, he probably has medium to long hair! He does great on leash, seems to have been indoor dog and housebroken. <br><br>He accepted the routine at the shelter as his life now. He gets put in the \"run\" to play while his kennel is hosed and cleaned in the morning and then spends the day with the room mate of the day, which he tolerates well!<br><br>We really hope that someone will offer to adopt this poor boy through Lost and Found Dog Rescue so he can spend the rest of his golden years with someone who will love him. He deserves so much more then what has happened to him.<br><br>If interested, please contact us at:<br>(302) 323-1096.  </div>',\n",

His new mommy and daddy are so wonderful they are going to help him through his recovery and see that he gets all the love and attention that he deserves for the rest of his life. It\\'s such a great ending, well actually beginning, for a poor boy who was on death row at the SPCA.<br /><br />Update-His second day in foster care Brody started limping. We took him to the vet right away and had him looked at. After taking some x-rays the vet came to the conclusion that poor Brody was probably hit by a car before and not taken care of. He is scheduled for surgery to remove some floating bone chips. He will have a couple courses of physical therapy and then enjoy the rest of his life playing ball and going for lots of walks.<br /><br />Brody has been neutured. While at the vet he was tested for Lyme and found to be positive for Lyme disease. That is why this rescue group tests for tick-borne diseases. Too many people do not and their dog can get very sick \"if\" they have Lyme and they don\\'t know it. <br /><br />Brody will need a few months of antibiotics. By keeping him on antibiotics and testing his urine as we did, he will be just fine. By taking an aggressive stand against Lyme now, we\\'ll be able to be sure he stays healthy for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Being forewarned about Lyme is being armed against it. Everyone should keep every pet on Preventic collars and Frontline Plus year round to protect their dogs from Lyme. You don\\'t have to go into the woods to get Lyme anymore.<br />The vaccine is no longer 100% effective.<br /><br />We finally got poor Brody out of the SPCA! He was at the Georgetown SPCA for about two months. This is a very long time for a shelter dog. He is truly a gentleman and a great big sweetheart. <br /><br />Brody is a handsome Chocolate lab. He is estimated to be around 4 years old. He loves people and enjoys going for walks.

She sits, comes,downs, and jumps up on things with voice or hand signals.  She will also climb a ladder if you ask her to.  She is housebroken, crate trained, and excellant with children.  I would not place her with children that are not walking, as she does have a high prey drive with smaller animals.  She also is very particular with what adult dogs she likes as she was attacked twice in the shelter before being rescued.  She is food aggressive with other animals, but not people.  She is also not a barker.  This girl would definately be a keeper if I did not have fosters, or my own dogs already.<br></div>',\n",

He and Snickers are getting along well, Snickers has only growled twice. oing to get one of her table scraps. Other than that they have played most of the afternoon and evening. Right now Lucky is sacked out in the hallway right by me (the carpet is thicker and the light isn\\'t as bright!) and seems to be enjoying his nap. He ate well (thanks to the hamburger and rice mixture!) and had his share of treats. I did mean to ask you his feeding schedule, how often and how much. I will put him and Snickers on the same schedule but I don\\'t want to make any changes right away.  <br><br>He didn\\'t get in the kiddie pool and looked at Snickers as if she were an alien when she was ripping around in it but he will drink out of it. He also won\\'t go down the basement stairs. Our basement is finished but one side of the stairway is open. He will venture down a few steps but then scurries back up. I\\'m sure he\\'ll be ripping up and down them in no time.<br><br>I guess that\\'s about it for Lucky\\'s first day at home. I\\'m sure he misses you and his playpals but he and Snickers did put on quite a few miles (he wore her out!) and I\\'m sure they\\'ll be just as busy tomorrow. I will get some pictures for you as soon as we figure out what is wrong with our digital camera...the battery keeps going dead. Thanks again for taking such good care of him === he\\'s a sweetheart!<br>Darlene <br><br>Our dear Lucky met his new parents tonight and he was just so happy to meet them. It is a good thing they liked him also because his foster Mom said that he really seemed to \"pick\" them to be his new family. We are all so happy that this poor boy who nearly starved to death out there on the streets, ended up on death row at a SPCA is now going home forever! It was a VERY good day in rescue!<br><br>PLEASE NOTE:  Lucky does have a mild case of heartworm. His chest x-ray came up negative which proves he has NO damage to his heart at all. He will be able to live a normal, perfectly healthy life since we have treated his heartworm. Heartworm is only fatal IF it is not treated. <br> <br>He will also need at least (4) weeks of being on a leash and resting to completely recover from his treatment. <br><br>New Update from Lucky\\'s foster mom:<br>Lucky is going to be a treasure for whoever adopts him.  This poor neglected boy has come a long way in just a week. He knows his name and greets us with a full body wag, rolling over to have his belly rubbed and giving us doggie kisses.  He LOVES our dog Cody and follows him around doing whatever he does all day, so he?d definitely love to have another dog to bond with at his new home. He?s now crate trained and stays all night and for several hours during the day with no problem.  He will not soil his crate and will bark in the morning and then almost knock you off your feet pulling you out the door to relieve himself afterwards.  During the day, when loose in the house, there are no accidents as long as we take him out every few hours.  We are working on improving the length of time he can hold it, but he?s doing great considering this is the first time he?s lived in a house as well as the first time he?s ever had enough to eat and drink.  He?s learned the idea of sit, come, the leash and the invisible fence but still needs to be more consistent. And now that we?ve done a lot of grooming, his coat looks much better and you can really see the gorgeous dog he?s going to be.  Lucky is smart, and loving, and beautiful- what could be better than that!<br><br>Update from Lucky\\'s foster parents:<br>Poor Bear was a golden retriever who had had a very unlucky life.

He has been diagnosed with a mild case of heartworm, but there?s no damage and he will recover completely after his treatment.  He had to be shaved down because his thick coat was matted so badly, and he?s literally skin and bones underneath.  He?s never been in a house, had a toy, or been petted.  But despite that he?s a happy, friendly, good-natured boy, who loves playing with other dogs and is finally learning to associate people with good things. For example, instead of looking surprised and confused when we touch him, he?s already learned that petting is really, really nice.  At his foster home, we?ll be working with his house training, crate training, leash training, and basic commands, as well as learning the invisible fence, and in only two days he?s come a long way.<br><br>Lucky will be a beautiful dog once he gains weight and regrows his coat.

As you know, this is a fairly common combination<br>at the Kent shelter.  We met our first Kent County shelter dog as part of<br>Lost-and-Found\\'s monthly open house at Concord Pets in northern Delaware.<br>We were touched by her sweet personality and adorable face.<br> <br>We had recently lost a much-beloved adopted Boston Terrier named Cindy, who<br>came to us as an elderly lady and spent the last three years of her life<br>with us.  We both fell in love with a Lost-and-Found rescuee named Mindy,<br>who was originally from the Kent shelter.<br> <br>We discussed the possibility of adopting Mindy, but then we realized that we<br>had the time and resources to perform the \"remedial\" aspects of dog rescuing<br>in our own home.  So we decided to adopt a shelter dog directly, and work<br>with him/her so that they\\'d receive the same benefits as if he/she had been<br>a part of Lost-and-Found\\'s program.<br> <br>One day later, my sister called me to say that she had been at Petsmart in<br>Dover, and had seen a kennel full of dachshund mixes who all looked exactly<br>like Mindy (I\\'d sent her a photo), and that there was one dog in particular<br>that had a certain \"aura\" about him.<br> <br>(We are definitely a family of \"woo woo\" types, just like granola we\\'re \"all<br>nuts and flakes\".  I had every reason to trust my sister and nephew\\'s<br>intuition about this dog.)<br> <br>I called the Kent SPCA the next morning, and by lunchtime I was at the<br>shelter and meeting Freddy.  Sure enough, we had an immediate bond, and I<br>knew that we\\'d found our new doggie.<br> <br>He was the largest and oldest of the dachshund mixes, and he had a skittish<br>personality.  I knew that he would need a lot of love and teaching, but that<br>was what we had asked God to send us -- a dog who needed us, and who might<br>not be successfully adopted by a less-adaptable family.<br> <br>Freddy slept in the passenger seat, all the way back to Wilmington.  And<br>when he arrived at our home, he moved in as if he\\'d been here forever.<br> <br>He had some issues that we expected to encounter: housetraining, learning<br>basic commands, etc.  He was definitely a diamond-in-the-rough; I don\\'t<br>think that he\\'d ever lived inside a house with a human family.  But we<br>immediately signed up for remedial adult-dog classes, and after a slow<br>start, Freddy is now performing at the top of his class.  He is now a very<br>relaxed, happy, and loveable dog who expresses his contentment every day<br>with cuddling and kisses.<br> <br>He even gets along well with our cat Anya, whom we fostered three years ago<br>as a semi-feral young mother with five one-day-old kittens.  Anya and Freddy<br>have formed a strong friendship, and except for occasional hissy-fits, they<br>are always together and enjoying each other\\'s playfulness and companionship.<br> <br>Without meeting the folks at Lost-and-Found, we would never have recognized<br>our attraction to dachshunds, and wouldn\\'t have ever mentioned it to my<br>sister who lives downstate.  And Kent County SPCA gave me such a warm<br>welcome on our adoption day, that I\\'ve continually suggested this shelter to<br>everyone who meets Freddy.  Because everyone who meets him, falls in love<br>with him immediately.  I\\'ve probably told about 100 people about him<br>personally, and also mentioned both organizations in my online catalog (I<br>make custom jewelry and sell the items via the Net.)<br> <br>I\\'ve learned that this combination of dachshund/beagle is a common breed on<br>the Delmarva Peninsula.  Apparently this lineage of dogs has been bred since<br>1876 on the Eastern Shore.  Maybe that\\'s why so many dogs at Kent County<br>SPCA are similar in appearance...all redhaired and stubby, with sweet<br>dachshund faces and sturdy beagle bodies.  Freddy really does look like<br>Mindy from Lost-and-Found.  He\\'s a handsome dappled-red doggie, with a<br>dachshund face and a mostly-beagle body (just an inch or two shorter in the<br>legs!)  My veterinarian says that he will probably not suffer from the<br>spinal issues that plague purebred dachshunds, and that\\'s a good thing,<br>because Freddy is a fearless climber and jumper, especially when playing<br>with the cat!<br> <br>His personality is absolutely wonderful, and he\\'s won our hearts completely.<br><br>We hope that he will be able to continue his training, and eventually<br>become a visiting dog at our local nursing home.

He has HUGE feet, his adult teeth are already in and he weighs 35 lbs.  Louie is housetrained with a doggy door, and patiently waits (with an occasional whine) in the morning by the closed doggy door until he\\'s let out for his morning routine. <br> <br>Louie does the occasional Basset 500 so could easily knock down a small child; Louie would best fit into a home with children of at least 8 years of age.  Louie LOVES to play fetch and will bring his rope toy (his favorite), ball, etc. right back to you.  He hasn\\'t learned to drop it at your feet yet, but we\\'re working on that skill now.  Louie loves to go for walks and wants to \\'meet\\' every person or animal he meets along the way.  Although bassets aren\\'t exactly good jogging partners, a basset puppy has alot of energy and can easily take you for a \\'trot\\' around the block a time or two!<br><br>Louie is a real cuddler - especially when \\'wearing down\\'! - who turns into your own personal \\'cuddle bug/lap dog\\'.  Louie usually sleeps on the bed with his foster mom...and this smart young guy has figured out how to nose his way under the covers!  He still wants to be close to his foster mom or one of his foster sisters when he goes to bed at night.  Louie has fit in with his older, foster sisters pretty well, but he does like to get \\'in their face\\' and bark at them for attention, or if they have a chew bone and he decides he wants THAT chew bone!  As obnoxious as a puppy can be to an older dog, Louie has also fallen in love with his two foster sisters and licks their ears and eyes letting them know that he cares about them.  The three of them make beautiful music together when they decide to all sing the Basset Anthem (\\'Ahhhrrroooooo!\\') at the same time. <br><br>Louie wants his foster cats to run and play with him, but he hasn\\'t been very successful with his attempts; he\\'ll run after one cat when that cats runs, then he\\'ll run FROM the other cat when that cat runs after HIM! <br><br>Louie is a happy, healthy puppy with much love to offer to the right forever home.  Louie needs a home with someone who has a lot of time to devote to training a puppy that is quite active and loves attention.  Louie would easily fit into a home with a stay-at-home or works-part-time parent/adult(s), with older children (8 yrs +) in the home, and other dogs and/or cats.  Louie needs a fairly big yard to run and play in to burn off alot of his puppy energy.  Louie enjoys riding in the car/truck, and definitely picks up on when it\\'s time to \\'go\\'.  Louie has done great with his visits to a groomer and dog parks.  Per Louie\\'s foster mom, \\'he\\'s the best basset puppy anyone would want to have!\\' </div>',\n",

He is an absolute sweetheart. Scottie is a great companion and just desires to please. He is content to be outside and great with other dogs. We have to remind ourselves that he is a puppy because he is so well behaved. He really enjoys the beautiful Tasha as you see in his photos, they are almost inseperable. Scottie is not crazy about the crate but he takes it in stride. He does sleep in there at night but does make a fuss if he hears you in the morning. As with his brothers, Spock and Kirk, it is obvious that he was mistreated. He is very quick to show you his belly if he senses you might be upset, very submissive. Scottie is one of those dogs that you don\\'t mind getting big kisses from. He is so gentle and just wants to smother you in kisses. He has very expressive eyes, and is a gentile sweet soul. Scottie would fit into any type of household.<br><br>Hi Marleen,<br>I am in love with a little dog! I never expected it but this little guy is so sweet! He is just one of those thankful dogs and he says it all with his eyes and his sweet and gentle kisses.<br><br>His behavior has been exemplary, not one mistake in the house and everything he has chewed was his. He loves to play and is very joyful and has a wonderful disposition. When you see him you can\\'t help but smile.<br><br>It\\'s so odd for me being a big dog person to have a small guy in the house but I just love having him around.

He is an absolute sweetheart. Scottie is a great companion and just desires to please. He is content to be outside and great with other dogs. We have to remind ourselves that he is a puppy because he is so well behaved. He really enjoys the beautiful Tasha as you see in his photos, they are almost inseperable. Scottie is not crazy about the crate but he takes it in stride. He does sleep in there at night but does make a fuss if he hears you in the morning. As with his brothers, Spock and Kirk, it is obvious that he was mistreated. He is very quick to show you his belly if he senses you might be upset, very submissive. Scottie is one of those dogs that you don\\'t mind getting big kisses from. He is so gentle and just wants to smother you in kisses. He has very expressive eyes, and is a gentile sweet soul. Scottie would fit into any type of household.<br><br>Hi Marleen,<br>I am in love with a little dog! I never expected it but this little guy is so sweet! He is just one of those thankful dogs and he says it all with his eyes and his sweet and gentle kisses.<br><br>His behavior has been exemplary, not one mistake in the house and everything he has chewed was his. He loves to play and is very joyful and has a wonderful disposition. When you see him you can\\'t help but smile.<br><br>It\\'s so odd for me being a big dog person to have a small guy in the house but I just love having him around. He is a BIG dog in a SMALL dog\\'s body. Anyone that meets him just absolutely falls in love with him. To know Scottie is to love Scottie.

She\\'s now Cyan (pronounced like Diane with an S).<br>She is just a doll and getting along with everyone wonderfully.   The first night was a bit \"growly\", but I expected that --- she was really nervous.  She now follows me all over the house and greets Ben everyday when we pick him up with tons of kisses.<br>Thanks again for everything.  You are a very dedicated person and it shows that you truely love all your doggies.<br>I did not forget about you with the collars, etc.  This week has just been a bit busy with adjustments.<br>Take care, <br>Michelle<br><br><br><br>My name is Cecilia, or CC for short.  I think I am a Terrier Mix.  I am very petite, only 25 pounds and I\\'m probably full grown. I have been told that I am a VERY sweet natured little girl.  I am social and calm and I have a quiet disposition.  I like to be around people and I am usually content just to sit quietly in the company of humans.  I like new people, adults and children alike.  I am curious and gentle when I greet humans and I do not like to jump up on people when I greet them.  I think I am a pretty well behaved girl and my under-lying philosophy is:  I aim to please. <br><br>Aside from the company of humans, I enjoy interacting with both dogs and cats.  New dogs are always exciting and I am my most animated in the company of other animals.  I am on the submissive side, so there never seems to be any aggression or anger in my interactions with other dogs.  I like to go to the fenced-in dog park and I think the large dogs\\u2019 park is the most fun, I just insist on playing with the big boys!  I run like the wind and I like keeping up with the larger dogs.  I like picking up sticks and toys and carrying them in my mouth.  I do not do much in the way of fetching, but once in awhile I will bring it back to you.  I think that if someone taught me that this was a game, I would really enjoy it.<br><br>However, as I mentioned, dogs are not the only animals I like.  There are two cats in the house I am staying in and I do the downplay thing and try to engage them, but I never hurt them. One cat in particular likes me a lot and will wrestle gently with me. I am twice the cat\\u2019s size, but when he walks up to my food bowl or water bowl, I let him have it.  My humans usually take the cat out so I may eat my meal in peace.<br><br>Let\\u2019s see,  do pretty well in the house.  I have not had any accidents in my house.  I go outside to do my business.  My humans take me to the same spot and I go like clockwork:  first thing in the morning, once during the day and in the evening.  I like to chew, and so far have only chewed what was given to me as a toy.  I have a furry bone with a squeaky in it, I like plastic bottles (just love that sound), raw hides, hurl-a-squirrels and an old shirt tied up with a knot.  One time I got the urge to chew up some newspaper, but I just have not had the taste for it again.  <br><br>I do not like to jump up on people, but occasionally I want to be close to my humans and I stand on my back legs with my paws on their chest.  I am just trying to be close to them, but they do not encourage this behavior and I do not do it much anymore. I understand that if I sit and/or lay down, I will get all the kisses and love I am seeking.  I like to sleep with my humans.  I have slept in the crate, but I do well out of the crate on my blanket.   I do not move from my spot all night.  I also know that if I stay on my spot in the morning when they get up, I will get all the cuddles and kisses I desire.  I am so excited to start my day, but I enjoy the minute or two of cuddles on my spot and I let them know it! <br><br>I do not talk much, in fact, you will only hear me speak when there is someone I want to meet (animal or human), but cannot physically reach.<br><br>I sound great, don\\'t I? Right now, I seem to have a thing for cheese.  I will go just about anywhere for cheese.  Riding in cars are good by me \\u2013 I just mostly sleep.<br><br>Overall, I am very pleasant to be around, and very sweet natured.  I know how to sit and I think I understand the go to your spot thing.  I like being around people and other dogs and cats, and I would imagine a home with children and other pets would be a good fit.<br><br>If you would like to fill out an application, you must first register on the website and await an e-mailed passcode.
