##Motivation
This projects begs the question: how can we use publicly available data to help rescue groups find homes for dogs? What can we divine from this information to make these groups better? And can we predict how long a dog will be up for adoption?

This project has personal significance for me because of this gorgeous girl, who would have been euthanized if I hadn't adopted her. She is the most beautiful and perfect dog in the world.
