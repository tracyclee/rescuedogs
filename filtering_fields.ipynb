      " u'<div class=\"rgDescription\">UPDATE: Our sweet girl went home today with her new Mom and older brother & sister who are also rescued \"shelter kids\" so we know she will have the kind of loving home we want for all our kids. She met her new family and was just so pleased to have new friends. Kristie is such a special girl and it took awhile but we found her forever home. Very happy for everyone. She will bring much joy into this family. I was happy for her but sad for me to not have that baby in my life everyday.<br><br>Kristie is a very calm, gentle, laid back \"old soul\" even though she is not even 1 year old yet. She LOVES everyone, including kids, dogs & cats she meets. She has the most beautiful, expressive, copper colored, Cleopatra shaped eyes that are as soft and gentle as she is. <br><br>My husband (and I can not stress this enough!) who is often \"less then delighted\" at all the dogs/pups I foster at one time, really, really likes Kristie. In order for my husband to \"like\" one of the foster dogs, he has criteria. His criteria is: They must be short-haired, quiet, NO BARKING, calm, gentle, affectionate, and come to you for cuddles --- without being pushy. Kristie meets all that criteria and much more. She is the ONLY foster dog who is not crated. She has \"earned\" the right not to be crated when we\\'re not home or at bedtime. She is a perfect little pup!<br><br>Over the long weekend I saw him mindlessly petting & stroking her while he was watching TV on the sofa. She was in heaven to have that much attention. She is a perfect little soul, under 40 pounds and I can not believe she has not been adopted yet. She is the easiest foster pup I have!! I know she is not the \"prettiest girl at the prom\" --- but her beauty is in her heart and spirit!<br><br>Whoever adopts her will be very lucky to have such a sweet, affectionate, couch potato in their life. 80% of the time she can be found on the corner of my sofa with a pillow tucked under her chin and her head on one or two --- if she can manage it. This girl LOVES to be comfortable. The other 20% is spent sitting on a crate on the sunporch looking out the window. She has had a tough start in life and was terribly neglected. I feel she deserves nothing but the best and if being on the sofa & pillows make her happy, then sofa & pillows it should be!<br> <br>Kristie is a sweet, adorable, and very affectionate! I was confused about her heritage but now I feel she is probably mixed with CAT! As you can see by the pictures, she is happiest when she can be sitting or laying on something high up. I have dog crates on my sunporch and that is her other favorite place besides my sofa. She just sits and look out the window, which is what she really enjoys doing. <br><br>She greets everyone who comes to visit with a whole body wag and a doggie kiss. She\\'s completely trained to the invisible fence now, crate trained and housebroken. She understands the meaning of commands sit, come, stay, down, and heel, but needs consistent training to learn to obey reliably. <br> <br>She\\u2019s definitely a shoe stealer, but the funny thing is, although she\\'ll sneak them one at a time from a closet, she\\'ll pick out a \"Matching Pair\" and then sit with them on the sofa looking very proud of herself.  She\\u2019s even grouped her toys together sometimes - two bones or two rings. What an organized dog! Amazing!!! She has not chewed anything, she just seems to be a \"Collector\" of items!<br><br>Kristie went through her successful Heartworm treatment. She has been given a 100% complete bill of health from our vet. Due to being so young, she must<br>have just become infected but does not have any any residual damage from the heartworm. <br><br>UPDATE from Kristie\\'s foster Mom: Everyone who\\'s met Kristie says her pictures do not do her justice and that she\\'s so-o-o- much cuter than they show! Kristie is an enormous sweetheart, calm and reserved in public places around lots of people and dogs, and more outgoing and active at home. <br><br>UPDATE from Kristie\\'s foster parents:<br>A couple of observations- I would upgrade Kristie to \\u201cvery friendly\\u201d since she\\u2019s climbed into the lap and licked the face of everyone she\\u2019s met.  She definitely craves attention and play time, although she\\u2019s not what I would call a high energy dog and can spend long periods in her crate.  But if she doesn\\'t have a stay at home person to spend a lot of time with, I think she\\'d really like to have another dog or kids to play with.   <br><br>All L&F dogs/pups are crate & potty trained, temperament tested, have been chosen for sweet & gentle dispositions, have lived in foster homes with families, and have had the following:<br><br>SPAYED/NEUTERED<br><br>Microchipping<br><br>Tested for Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia<br><br>On HeartGuard & Frontline Plus<br><br>Rabies, Distemper, Parvo vaccines.<br><br>Intra Trac ll Kennel Cough<br><br>Two De-Worming<br><br>No dog 6 months and up will ever leave L&F Dog Rescue without being spayed/neutered. Spay/Neuter is MANDATORY.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: We do not place puppies in homes where no one will be home all day. Puppies, like babies, need lots of attention, socialization and cuddles. We do not feel that it is humane to leave them in a crate for 8-10 hour alone.<br><br>If you are applying for an adult dog, we do expect that if no one is home all day, arrangements will be made to provide the dog with at least (1) \"potty break\" daily, whether it is through a family member, neighbor or petsitting service. We know that it is impossible for us humans to \"hold it\" for 8-10 hours, so we do not want our \"shelter kids\" to be expected to do so.<br><br>We have several petsitting service companies that we can recommend:<br><br>www.homesweethomepetsit.org/ in PA & DE<br><br>www.delawarepooperscoopers.com in PA, NJ, & DE<br><br>http://www.tlcpetsitting.net/ in MD<br><br>We also have a wonderful all day Doggy Day Care service:<br>Fuzzy Butts Doggy Day Care in Chadds Ford, PA<br>www.fuzzybuttsPA.com<br>(I have visited this facility and it is wonderful and reasonable)<br></div>'\n",

Sammi is very playful and was very, very excited to meet this small little thing --- but I watched Paris face light up at being chased around the big back yard. <br><br>I really think her Mommy is going to have her hands full with all this activity but she assured me she is up to the task. Paris is going to be a Jersey girl like her Aunt Marleen!<br><br><br><br>This is our new baby Paris who is about 2 months old. You can see how pretty she is!

I have one picture of her with Nikki who is a terrier mix so you can see her size compared to Nikki.<br><br>She was found abandoned alone in a box.
